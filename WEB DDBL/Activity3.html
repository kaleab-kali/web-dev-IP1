                        Pizza delivery is a great way for families and friends to celebrate together.
                        DoorDash data shows that the ten most popular holidays for food delivery include
                        Mother's Day, New Year's Eve, Halloween, Thanksgiving Eve, Veteran's Day, Labor Day,
                        Father's Day, Memorial Day, Indigenous Peoples' Day, and Black Friday — so launching
                        marketing campaigns tailored to these dates can have powerful payoffs. For example,
                        pizza delivery orders on DoorDash were up over 27% on Halloween 2019 compared to
                        the average Friday in October (making this a scary good day for promotions).
                        Beyond promoting pizza-related holidays, find creative ways to celebrate your
                        signature dishes all year long. Take National Margarita Day (February 22), for instance.
                        The holiday may be referring to the famous cocktail, but why not use a clever play on words
                        to celebrate your classic margherita pie — or take things one step further by offering a
                        "Margherita & Margs" promo?
